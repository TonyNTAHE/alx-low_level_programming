## Hello, World
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX.It aims to learn about what happen under the hood when you run `gcc`, what is preposser,complier,assembler and linker phases.

#Technologies
* C files are complied using gcc 4.8.4
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in c:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-preprocessor` | runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.|
| `1-complier` | script that compiles a `C` file but does not link.|
| `2-assember` | generates the assembly code of a `C` code and save it in an output file.|
| `3-name` | script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.|
| `4-puts` | prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.|
| `5-printf.c`| prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.|
| `6-size.c`  | prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.|
| `100-intel` | generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.|
| `101-quote` | prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.|

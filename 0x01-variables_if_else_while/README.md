## C- Variables, if, else, while

* This Project was done during ALX software programming in the first sprint, and it aims on how
to use variables and looping condictions like if, else and while .
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

## C- File I/O

* This Project was done during ALX software programming in the first sprint, and it aims on how
to create, open, close, read and write files.
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

|File                        |    Description                                                                         |

|  `0-read_textfile.c`       |        function that reads a text file and prints it to the `POSIX` standard output    |
|  `1-create_file.c`        |        function that  creates a file                       |
|   `2-get_bit.c`            |        function that returns the value of a bit at given index                         |
|   '3-set_bit.c'            |        function that sets the value of a bit `1` at a given index                      |
|   `4-clear_bit.c`          |        function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index                   |
|   `5-flip_bits.c`          |returns the number of bits you fliped to get from one number to another                 |
